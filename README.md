# My Website Code

* Powered by Vanilla
  * Check `/content/static/js/script.js` for more information
* I built mostly everything you see, credit given for scroll-locking helper functions (thank you @gblazex)
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4770025/how-to-disable-scrolling-temporarily
* Mandelbrots were generated by my mandelbrot repository

This is my take on a personal website. Thanks for visiting!
